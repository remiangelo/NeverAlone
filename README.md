## 💫 Why Never Alone?

Recovery is challenging, but it doesn't have to be lonely. This app aims to:

- **Reduce barriers** to finding support meetings when they're needed most
- **Encourage daily reflection** through journaling and mood tracking
- **Celebrate progress** by visualizing clean time and recovery milestones
- **Connect individuals** to a broader recovery community and resources
- **Maintain privacy** with optional account creation and local-only storage options

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 **Meeting Finder**  
  Easily locate NA/AA meetings near you by zip code, day of week, or meeting format (in-person/online). View meeting details and locations on an integrated map powered by Mapbox.

- 📓 **Daily Journal & Mood Tracker**  
  Document your recovery journey with daily reflections. Track emotional patterns over time to identify triggers and growth areas.

- ⏳ **Clean Time Tracker**  
  Record your sobriety date and visualize your progress with a clean time counter and achievement badges for important milestones.

- 🔐 **Privacy-Focused Design**  
  Choose between account creation for cross-device synchronization or local-only storage for maximum privacy.

- 📚 **Recovery Resources**  
  Access NA and AA literature, helpful articles, and community resources directly within the app.
